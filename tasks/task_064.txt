# Task ID: 64
# Title: Add Yarn Support for Taskmaster Installation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement full support for installing and managing Taskmaster using Yarn package manager, providing users with an alternative to npm and pnpm.
# Details:
This task involves adding comprehensive Yarn support to the Taskmaster package to ensure it can be properly installed and managed using Yarn. Implementation should include:

1. Update package.json to ensure compatibility with Yarn installation methods
2. Verify all scripts and dependencies work correctly with Yarn
3. Add Yarn-specific configuration files (e.g., .yarnrc.yml if needed)
4. Update installation documentation to include Yarn installation instructions
5. Ensure all post-install scripts work correctly with Yarn
6. Verify that all CLI commands function properly when installed via Yarn
7. Handle any Yarn-specific package resolution or hoisting issues
8. Test compatibility with different Yarn versions (classic and berry/v2+)
9. Ensure proper lockfile generation and management
10. Update any package manager detection logic in the codebase to recognize Yarn installations

The implementation should maintain feature parity regardless of which package manager (npm, pnpm, or Yarn) is used to install Taskmaster.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify complete Yarn support through the following steps:

1. Fresh installation tests:
   - Install Taskmaster using `yarn add taskmaster` (global and local installations)
   - Verify installation completes without errors
   - Check that all binaries and executables are properly linked

2. Functionality tests:
   - Run all Taskmaster commands on a Yarn-installed version
   - Verify all features work identically to npm/pnpm installations
   - Test with both Yarn v1 (classic) and Yarn v2+ (berry)

3. Update/uninstall tests:
   - Test updating the package using Yarn commands
   - Verify clean uninstallation using Yarn

4. CI integration:
   - Add Yarn installation tests to CI pipeline
   - Test on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)

5. Documentation verification:
   - Ensure all documentation accurately reflects Yarn installation methods
   - Verify any Yarn-specific commands or configurations are properly documented

6. Edge cases:
   - Test installation in monorepo setups using Yarn workspaces
   - Verify compatibility with other Yarn-specific features (plug'n'play, zero-installs)

All tests should pass with the same results as when using npm or pnpm.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Update package.json for Yarn Compatibility [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the package.json file to ensure all dependencies, scripts, and configurations are compatible with Yarn's installation and resolution methods.
### Details:
Review and update dependency declarations, script syntax, and any package manager-specific fields to avoid conflicts or unsupported features when using Yarn.

## 2. Add Yarn-Specific Configuration Files [pending]
### Dependencies: 64.1
### Description: Introduce Yarn-specific configuration files such as .yarnrc.yml if needed to optimize Yarn behavior and ensure consistent installs.
### Details:
Determine if Yarn v2+ (Berry) or classic requires additional configuration for the project, and add or update .yarnrc.yml or .yarnrc files accordingly.

## 3. Test and Fix Yarn Compatibility for Scripts and CLI [pending]
### Dependencies: 64.2
### Description: Ensure all scripts, post-install hooks, and CLI commands function correctly when Taskmaster is installed and managed via Yarn.
### Details:
Test all lifecycle scripts, post-install actions, and CLI commands using Yarn. Address any issues related to environment variables, script execution, or dependency hoisting.

## 4. Update Documentation for Yarn Installation and Usage [pending]
### Dependencies: 64.3
### Description: Revise installation and usage documentation to include clear instructions for installing and managing Taskmaster with Yarn.
### Details:
Add Yarn-specific installation commands, troubleshooting tips, and notes on version compatibility to the README and any relevant docs.

## 5. Implement and Test Package Manager Detection Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 64.4
### Description: Update or add logic in the codebase to detect Yarn installations and handle Yarn-specific behaviors, ensuring feature parity across package managers.
### Details:
Modify detection logic to recognize Yarn (classic and berry), handle lockfile generation, and resolve any Yarn-specific package resolution or hoisting issues.
