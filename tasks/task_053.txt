# Task ID: 53
# Title: Implement Subtask Suggestion Feature for Parent Tasks
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a new CLI command that suggests contextually relevant subtasks for existing parent tasks, allowing users to accept, decline, or regenerate suggestions before adding them to the system.
# Details:
Develop a new command `suggest-subtask <task-id>` that generates intelligent subtask suggestions for a specified parent task. The implementation should:

1. Accept a parent task ID as input and validate it exists
2. Gather a snapshot of all existing tasks in the system (titles only, with their statuses and dependencies)
3. Retrieve the full details of the specified parent task
4. Use this context to generate a relevant subtask suggestion that would logically help complete the parent task
5. Present the suggestion to the user in the CLI with options to:
   - Accept (a): Add the subtask to the system under the parent task
   - Decline (d): Reject the suggestion without adding anything
   - Regenerate (r): Generate a new alternative subtask suggestion
   - Edit (e): Accept but allow editing the title/description before adding

The suggestion algorithm should consider:
- The parent task's description and requirements
- Current progress (% complete) of the parent task
- Existing subtasks already created for this parent
- Similar patterns from other tasks in the system
- Logical next steps based on software development best practices

When a subtask is accepted, it should be properly linked to the parent task and assigned appropriate default values for priority and status.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the functionality and the quality of suggestions:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test command parsing and validation of task IDs
   - Test snapshot creation of existing tasks
   - Test the suggestion generation with mocked data
   - Test the user interaction flow with simulated inputs

2. Integration tests:
   - Create a test parent task and verify subtask suggestions are contextually relevant
   - Test the accept/decline/regenerate workflow end-to-end
   - Verify proper linking of accepted subtasks to parent tasks
   - Test with various types of parent tasks (frontend, backend, documentation, etc.)

3. Quality assessment:
   - Create a benchmark set of 10 diverse parent tasks
   - Generate 3 subtask suggestions for each and have team members rate relevance on 1-5 scale
   - Ensure average relevance score exceeds 3.5/5
   - Verify suggestions don't duplicate existing subtasks

4. Edge cases:
   - Test with a parent task that has no description
   - Test with a parent task that already has many subtasks
   - Test with a newly created system with minimal task history
