# Task ID: 41
# Title: Implement GitHub Actions CI Workflow for Task Master
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a streamlined CI workflow file (ci.yml) that efficiently tests the Task Master codebase using GitHub Actions.
# Details:
Create a GitHub Actions workflow file at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with the following specifications:

1. Configure the workflow to trigger on:
   - Push events to any branch
   - Pull request events targeting any branch

2. Core workflow configuration:
   - Use Ubuntu latest as the primary testing environment
   - Use Node.js 20.x (LTS) for consistency with the project
   - Focus on single environment for speed and simplicity

3. Configure workflow steps to:
   - Checkout the repository using actions/checkout@v4
   - Set up Node.js using actions/setup-node@v4 with npm caching
   - Install dependencies with 'npm ci'
   - Run tests with 'npm run test:coverage'

4. Implement efficient caching:
   - Cache node_modules using actions/cache@v4
   - Use package-lock.json hash for cache key
   - Implement proper cache restoration keys

5. Ensure proper timeouts:
   - 2 minutes for dependency installation
   - Appropriate timeout for test execution

6. Artifact handling:
   - Upload test results and coverage reports
   - Use consistent naming for artifacts
   - Retain artifacts for 30 days

# Test Strategy:
To verify correct implementation of the GitHub Actions CI workflow:

1. Manual verification:
   - Check that the file is correctly placed at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   - Verify the YAML syntax is valid
   - Confirm all required configurations are present

2. Functional testing:
   - Push a commit to verify the workflow triggers
   - Create a PR to verify the workflow runs on pull requests
   - Verify test coverage reports are generated and uploaded
   - Confirm caching is working effectively

3. Performance testing:
   - Verify cache hits reduce installation time
   - Confirm workflow completes within expected timeframe
   - Check artifact upload and download speeds
