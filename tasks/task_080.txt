# Task ID: 80
# Title: Implement Unique User ID Generation and Storage During Installation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Generate a unique user identifier during npm installation and store it in the .taskmasterconfig globals to enable anonymous usage tracking and telemetry without requiring user registration.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a mechanism to generate and store a unique user identifier during the npm installation process of Taskmaster. The implementation should:

1. Create a post-install script that runs automatically after npm install completes
2. Generate a cryptographically secure random UUID v4 as the unique user identifier
3. Check if a user ID already exists in the .taskmasterconfig file before generating a new one
4. Add the generated user ID to the globals section of the .taskmasterconfig file
5. Ensure the user ID persists across updates but is regenerated on fresh installations
6. Handle edge cases such as failed installations, manual deletions of the config file, or permission issues
7. Add appropriate logging to notify users that an anonymous ID is being generated (with clear privacy messaging)
8. Document the purpose of this ID in the codebase and user documentation
9. Ensure the ID generation is compatible with all supported operating systems
10. Make the ID accessible to the telemetry system implemented in Task #77

The implementation should respect user privacy by:
- Not collecting any personally identifiable information
- Making it clear in documentation how users can opt out of telemetry
- Ensuring the ID cannot be traced back to specific users or installations

This user ID will serve as the foundation for anonymous usage tracking, helping to understand how Taskmaster is used without compromising user privacy.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this feature should include:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Verify the UUID generation produces valid UUIDs
   - Test the config file reading and writing functionality
   - Ensure proper error handling for file system operations
   - Verify the ID remains consistent across multiple reads

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Run a complete npm installation in a clean environment and verify a new ID is generated
   - Simulate an update installation and verify the existing ID is preserved
   - Test the interaction between the ID generation and the telemetry system
   - Verify the ID is correctly stored in the expected location in .taskmasterconfig

3. **Manual Testing**:
   - Perform fresh installations on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Verify the installation process completes without errors
   - Check that the .taskmasterconfig file contains the generated ID
   - Test scenarios where the config file is manually deleted or corrupted

4. **Edge Case Testing**:
   - Test behavior when the installation is run without sufficient permissions
   - Verify handling of network disconnections during installation
   - Test with various npm versions to ensure compatibility
   - Verify behavior when .taskmasterconfig already exists but doesn't contain a user ID section

5. **Validation**:
   - Create a simple script to extract and analyze generated IDs to ensure uniqueness
   - Verify the ID format meets UUID v4 specifications
   - Confirm the ID is accessible to the telemetry system from Task #77

The test plan should include documentation of all test cases, expected results, and actual outcomes. A successful implementation will generate unique IDs for each installation while maintaining that ID across updates.
