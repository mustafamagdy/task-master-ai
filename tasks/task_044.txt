# Task ID: 44
# Title: Implement Task Automation with Webhooks and Event Triggers
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a system that allows users to automate task actions through webhooks and event triggers, enabling integration with external services and automated workflows.
# Details:
This feature will enable users to create automated workflows based on task events and external triggers. Implementation should include:

1. A webhook registration system that allows users to specify URLs to be called when specific task events occur (creation, status change, completion, etc.)
2. An event system that captures and processes all task-related events
3. A trigger definition interface where users can define conditions for automation (e.g., 'When task X is completed, create task Y')
4. Support for both incoming webhooks (external services triggering actions in Taskmaster) and outgoing webhooks (Taskmaster notifying external services)
5. A secure authentication mechanism for webhook calls
6. Rate limiting and retry logic for failed webhook deliveries
7. Integration with the existing task management system
8. Command-line interface for managing webhooks and triggers
9. Payload templating system allowing users to customize the data sent in webhooks
10. Logging system for webhook activities and failures

The implementation should be compatible with both the solo/local mode and the multiplayer/remote mode, with appropriate adaptations for each context. When operating in MCP mode, the system should leverage the MCP communication protocol implemented in Task #42.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the functionality and security of the webhook system:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test webhook registration, modification, and deletion
   - Verify event capturing for all task operations
   - Test payload generation and templating
   - Validate authentication logic

2. Integration tests:
   - Set up a mock server to receive webhooks and verify payload contents
   - Test the complete flow from task event to webhook delivery
   - Verify rate limiting and retry behavior with intentionally failing endpoints
   - Test webhook triggers creating new tasks and modifying existing ones

3. Security tests:
   - Verify that authentication tokens are properly validated
   - Test for potential injection vulnerabilities in webhook payloads
   - Verify that sensitive information is not leaked in webhook payloads
   - Test rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks

4. Mode-specific tests:
   - Verify correct operation in both solo/local and multiplayer/remote modes
   - Test the interaction with MCP protocol when in multiplayer mode

5. Manual verification:
   - Set up integrations with common services (GitHub, Slack, etc.) to verify real-world functionality
   - Verify that the CLI interface for managing webhooks works as expected
