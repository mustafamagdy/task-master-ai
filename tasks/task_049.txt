# Task ID: 49
# Title: Implement Code Quality Analysis Command
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a command that analyzes the codebase to identify patterns and verify functions against current best practices, generating improvement recommendations and potential refactoring tasks.
# Details:
Develop a new command called `analyze-code-quality` that performs the following functions:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - Scan the codebase to identify recurring patterns in code structure, function design, and architecture
   - Categorize patterns by frequency and impact on maintainability
   - Generate a report of common patterns with examples from the codebase

2. **Best Practice Verification**:
   - For each function in specified files, extract its purpose, parameters, and implementation details
   - Create a verification checklist for each function that includes:
     - Function naming conventions
     - Parameter handling
     - Error handling
     - Return value consistency
     - Documentation quality
     - Complexity metrics
   - Use an API integration with Perplexity or similar AI service to evaluate each function against current best practices

3. **Improvement Recommendations**:
   - Generate specific refactoring suggestions for functions that don't align with best practices
   - Include code examples of the recommended improvements
   - Estimate the effort required for each refactoring suggestion

4. **Task Integration**:
   - Create a mechanism to convert high-value improvement recommendations into Taskmaster tasks
   - Allow users to select which recommendations to convert to tasks
   - Generate properly formatted task descriptions that include the current implementation, recommended changes, and justification

The command should accept parameters for targeting specific directories or files, setting the depth of analysis, and filtering by improvement impact level.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify all aspects of the code analysis command:

1. **Functionality Testing**:
   - Create a test codebase with known patterns and anti-patterns
   - Verify the command correctly identifies all patterns in the test codebase
   - Check that function verification correctly flags issues in deliberately non-compliant functions
   - Confirm recommendations are relevant and implementable

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the AI service integration with mock responses to ensure proper handling of API calls
   - Verify the task creation workflow correctly generates well-formed tasks
   - Test integration with existing Taskmaster commands and workflows

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure execution time on codebases of various sizes
   - Ensure memory usage remains reasonable even on large codebases
   - Test with rate limiting on API calls to ensure graceful handling

4. **User Experience Testing**:
   - Have developers use the command on real projects and provide feedback
   - Verify the output is actionable and clear
   - Test the command with different parameter combinations

5. **Validation Criteria**:
   - Command successfully analyzes at least 95% of functions in the codebase
   - Generated recommendations are specific and actionable
   - Created tasks follow the project's task format standards
   - Analysis results are consistent across multiple runs on the same codebase
