# Task ID: 48
# Title: Refactor Prompts into Centralized Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a dedicated 'prompts' folder and move all prompt definitions from inline function implementations to individual files, establishing a centralized prompt management system.
# Details:
This task involves restructuring how prompts are managed in the codebase:

1. Create a new 'prompts' directory at the appropriate level in the project structure
2. For each existing prompt currently embedded in functions:
   - Create a dedicated file with a descriptive name (e.g., 'task_suggestion_prompt.js')
   - Extract the prompt text/object into this file
   - Export the prompt using the appropriate module pattern
3. Modify all functions that currently contain inline prompts to import them from the new centralized location
4. Establish a consistent naming convention for prompt files (e.g., feature_action_prompt.js)
5. Consider creating an index.js file in the prompts directory to provide a clean import interface
6. Document the new prompt structure in the project documentation
7. Ensure that any prompt that requires dynamic content insertion maintains this capability after refactoring

This refactoring will improve maintainability by making prompts easier to find, update, and reuse across the application.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify that the refactoring maintains identical functionality while improving code organization:

1. Automated Tests:
   - Run existing test suite to ensure no functionality is broken
   - Create unit tests for the new prompt import mechanism
   - Verify that dynamically constructed prompts still receive their parameters correctly

2. Manual Testing:
   - Execute each feature that uses prompts and compare outputs before and after refactoring
   - Verify that all prompts are properly loaded from their new locations
   - Check that no prompt text is accidentally modified during the migration

3. Code Review:
   - Confirm all prompts have been moved to the new structure
   - Verify consistent naming conventions are followed
   - Check that no duplicate prompts exist
   - Ensure imports are correctly implemented in all files that previously contained inline prompts

4. Documentation:
   - Verify documentation is updated to reflect the new prompt organization
   - Confirm the index.js export pattern works as expected for importing prompts
