# Task ID: 57
# Title: Enhance Task-Master CLI User Experience and Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve the Task-Master CLI's user experience by refining the interface, reducing verbose logging, and adding visual polish to create a more professional and intuitive tool.
# Details:
The current Task-Master CLI interface is functional but lacks polish and produces excessive log output. This task involves several key improvements:

1. Log Management:
   - Implement log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE)
   - Only show INFO and above by default
   - Add a --verbose flag to show all logs
   - Create a dedicated log file for detailed logs

2. Visual Enhancements:
   - Add a clean, branded header when the tool starts
   - Implement color-coding for different types of messages (success in green, errors in red, etc.)
   - Use spinners or progress indicators for operations that take time
   - Add clear visual separation between command input and output

3. Interactive Elements:
   - Add loading animations for longer operations
   - Implement interactive prompts for complex inputs instead of requiring all parameters upfront
   - Add confirmation dialogs for destructive operations

4. Output Formatting:
   - Format task listings in tables with consistent spacing
   - Implement a compact mode and a detailed mode for viewing tasks
   - Add visual indicators for task status (icons or colors)

5. Help and Documentation:
   - Enhance help text with examples and clearer descriptions
   - Add contextual hints for common next steps after commands

Use libraries like chalk, ora, inquirer, and boxen to implement these improvements. Ensure the interface remains functional in CI/CD environments where interactive elements might not be supported.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both functionality and user experience improvements:

1. Automated Tests:
   - Create unit tests for log level filtering functionality
   - Test that all commands still function correctly with the new UI
   - Verify that non-interactive mode works in CI environments
   - Test that verbose and quiet modes function as expected

2. User Experience Testing:
   - Create a test script that runs through common user flows
   - Capture before/after screenshots for visual comparison
   - Measure and compare the number of lines output for common operations

3. Usability Testing:
   - Have 3-5 team members perform specific tasks using the new interface
   - Collect feedback on clarity, ease of use, and visual appeal
   - Identify any confusion points or areas for improvement

4. Edge Case Testing:
   - Test in terminals with different color schemes and sizes
   - Verify functionality in environments without color support
   - Test with very large task lists to ensure formatting remains clean

Acceptance Criteria:
- Log output is reduced by at least 50% in normal operation
- All commands provide clear visual feedback about their progress and completion
- Help text is comprehensive and includes examples
- Interface is visually consistent across all commands
- Tool remains fully functional in non-interactive environments
