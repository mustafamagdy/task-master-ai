# Task ID: 47
# Title: Enhance Task Suggestion Actions Card Workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Redesign the suggestion actions card to implement a structured workflow for task expansion, subtask creation, context addition, and task management.
# Details:
Implement a new workflow for the suggestion actions card that guides users through a logical sequence when working with tasks and subtasks:

1. Task Expansion Phase:
   - Add a prominent 'Expand Task' button at the top of the suggestion card
   - Implement an 'Add Subtask' button that becomes active after task expansion
   - Allow users to add multiple subtasks sequentially
   - Provide visual indication of the current phase (expansion phase)

2. Context Addition Phase:
   - After subtasks are created, transition to the context phase
   - Implement an 'Update Subtask' action that allows appending context to each subtask
   - Create a UI element showing which subtask is currently being updated
   - Provide a progress indicator showing which subtasks have received context
   - Include a mechanism to navigate between subtasks for context addition

3. Task Management Phase:
   - Once all subtasks have context, enable the 'Set as In Progress' button
   - Add a 'Start Working' button that directs the agent to begin with the first subtask
   - Implement an 'Update Task' action that consolidates all notes and reorganizes them into improved subtask details
   - Provide a confirmation dialog when restructuring task content

4. UI/UX Considerations:
   - Use visual cues (colors, icons) to indicate the current phase
   - Implement tooltips explaining each action's purpose
   - Add a progress tracker showing completion status across all phases
   - Ensure the UI adapts responsively to different screen sizes

The implementation should maintain all existing functionality while guiding users through this more structured approach to task management.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify the complete workflow functions correctly:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test each button/action individually to ensure it performs its specific function
   - Verify state transitions between phases work correctly
   - Test edge cases (e.g., attempting to set a task in progress before adding context)

2. Integration Tests:
   - Verify the complete workflow from task expansion to starting work
   - Test that context added to subtasks is properly saved and displayed
   - Ensure the 'Update Task' functionality correctly consolidates and restructures content

3. UI/UX Testing:
   - Verify visual indicators correctly show the current phase
   - Test responsive design on various screen sizes
   - Ensure tooltips and help text are displayed correctly

4. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create test scenarios covering the complete workflow:
     a. Expand a task and add 3 subtasks
     b. Add context to each subtask
     c. Set the task as in progress
     d. Use update-task to restructure the content
     e. Verify the agent correctly begins work on the first subtask
   - Test with both simple and complex tasks to ensure scalability

5. Regression Testing:
   - Verify that existing functionality continues to work
   - Ensure compatibility with keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features
